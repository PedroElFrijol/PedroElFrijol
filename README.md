# About me

Hi, my name is Marcelo Raul Rios Junior (MJ) and I can program in Java, C/C++, Python, C#, Assembly and Makefile. I am currently working on OS Development and UEFI programming. I'm Mexican American and I have a twin brother. I'm a musician that plays the French horn, Trumpet, Mellophone, and Piano. November 2020 is when I started to first program in Java and moved on to game development and then to OS development.
